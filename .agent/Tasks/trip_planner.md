# Trip Planner Agent

## Problem / Goal
Create an initial OpenAI Agents SDK integration that can propose a grounded multi-day travel itinerary. This serves as a foundation for future workflow expansion.

## Solution Overview
- Track curated destination knowledge locally and expose it through an `lookup_destination` tool.
- Configure a single `TripPlanner` agent that relies on the tool and produces structured itineraries.
- Provide a CLI runner that defaults to an interactive REPL, with `--single-turn` available for one-off prompts.
- No need for test cases for now 

## Non-Goals
- Real-time voice experiences.
- External travel APIs or live pricing data.
- Persistent conversation memory across sessions.

## Notes
- The agent instructions emphasise gathering traveler context first; follow-up prompts improve quality.
- Extend the catalog in `src/merak_agent/common/destinations.py` to broaden coverage.

## Implementation Plan â€“ Chat Conversation Support
1. Consult the OpenAI Agents SDK session docs (e.g., `SQLiteSession` usage) to confirm best practices for multi-turn conversations.
2. Refactor `scripts/run_trip_planner.py` so `create_trip_planner_agent()` is instantiated once, a shared session (e.g., `SQLiteSession("trip_planner_cli")`) is created, and an interactive loop reads user input, routes each message through `Runner.run(..., session=session)`, and prints formatted responses.
3. Add exit controls (`exit`/`quit`) and lightweight input validation so the loop shuts down cleanly; keep the existing single-shot path available via a flag or helper to avoid breaking current usage patterns.
4. Abstract the new chat loop into testable helpers (e.g., `_run_chat_loop`) and cover them with unit tests that simulate multiple turns without hitting the live API.
5. Update README and internal docs with chat usage instructions, including how to start conversations and the session persistence behaviour.

## Current Status
- The CLI now launches a chat REPL by default; supply `--single-turn` for traditional one-shot runs and `--session-id` to persist history between processes.

## Open Bug: TypedDict Import Error (Python 3.11)

### Context
- Running `scripts/run_trip_planner.py` on Python 3.11 raises `pydantic.errors.PydanticUserError: Please use typing_extensions.TypedDict instead of typing.TypedDict on Python < 3.12.`
- Pydantic's [standard library types guide](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/api/standard_library_types/) notes that Python 3.12 and lower must import `TypedDict` from `typing_extensions` for validation.

### Fix Plan
1. **Update imports in `src/merak_agent/tools/destination_lookup.py`:** swap `from typing import TypedDict` for `from typing_extensions import TypedDict` to align with the documented requirement.
2. **Declare dependency:** add `typing_extensions>=4.9` to `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt` so the package is available in all environments.
3. **Run test suite:** execute `pytest` to confirm the lookup tool schema builds correctly after the change.
4. **Document resolution:** note the compatibility detail in README troubleshooting once verified.
