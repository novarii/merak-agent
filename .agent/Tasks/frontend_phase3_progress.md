# Frontend Phase 3 — Progress Log (2025-02-15)

## What’s Complete
- **Root layout sync**: `frontend/merak_web/app/layout.tsx` now mirrors the ChatKit starter by importing `globals.css`, injecting `chatkit.js` via `next/script` (`beforeInteractive`), and setting `<body className="antialiased">`.
- **App shell scaffolding**: Added `app/App.tsx` and rewired `app/page.tsx` so the page renders the shell directly. The shell mounts a new `ChatKitPanel` component and tracks color scheme state via `useColorScheme`.
- **Shared hooks & config**:
  - Implemented `hooks/useColorScheme.ts` to replicate the starter’s theme syncing, including localStorage persistence and `data-color-scheme` toggling.
  - Created `lib/config.ts` to centralize ChatKit constants (`CREATE_SESSION_ENDPOINT`, `STARTER_PROMPTS`, `getThemeConfig`, etc.) with Merak-specific copy.
- **UI primitives**: Stubbed `components/ChatKitPanel.tsx` with a full ChatKit integration placeholder that drives bootstrap/error overlays, theme bridging, and client tool hooks; added `components/ErrorOverlay.tsx` for blocking error/loading states.
- **API bridge scaffold**: Added `app/api/create-session/route.ts`, adapting the starter route so we can proxy either directly to OpenAI or to the upcoming FastAPI `/chatkit/session` helper while preserving cookie/session handling.
- **Tailwind v4 foundations**: Added Tailwind CSS 4, wired `@tailwindcss/postcss`, and replaced `app/globals.css` with the token-based theme so our new utilities (`bg-surface`, `text-foreground`, etc.) resolve correctly.

## Reflections / Open Questions
- The ChatKit panel still needs the actual `@openai/chatkit-react` dependency and start-screen visuals wired to Tailwind tokens; this will land once the component implementation solidifies.
- The create-session route currently points to a generic `/api/create-session`. Once the FastAPI helper exists we should confirm auth headers and payload shape, then add contract tests.
- Lint now passes after adding the required React ESLint plugins (hooks, core, refresh) that `eslint-config-next` expects.

## Next Steps
1. Flesh out `ChatKitPanel` with real ChatKit control logic (start screen, composer options, retry flow) once dependencies land; add smoke tests if feasible.
2. Update `.env.example` and docs to reflect required variables (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `CHATKIT_API_BASE`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_CHATKIT_WORKFLOW_ID`, `CHATKIT_SERVICE_TOKEN`).
3. Keep linting aligned with Next.js 15 as we add more components (consider migrating to the standalone ESLint CLI before Next.js 16).
